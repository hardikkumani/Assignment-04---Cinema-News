He is in talks with Paramount to join the cast of the follow-up to his sports action drama film.</p>
    <p>Days of Thunder was not a box office success when it was released and reviewers gave it mediocre to unfavourable reviews. However, having revived and modernised 1986’s Top Gun with 2022’s smash Top Gun: Maverick, the actor believes he can perform a similar feat with his racing drama.</p>

    <p>Todd was speaking to the Empire magazine as part of a filmmakers’ poll on what the future of showbiz would look like. “Stop showing commercials before the movies. We’ve paid for our tickets.

So I just give her a little google and look through the news, and I’m like, ‘She’s good,” he said.

Asked about his feelings on deepfakes and AI technology, Downey said, “There’s two tracks. How do I feel about everything that’s going on?

    <h2>1. Lokesh Kanagaraj reveals his plans for LCU; shares final update on ‘Thalapathy’ Vijay’s Leo 2</h2>
    <img src="./img/lcu-06112024.avif">
    <p>While India now has no shortage of film franchises — if anything, there’s an abundance — Tamil director Lokesh Kanagaraj’s Lokesh Cinematic Universe (LCU) stands out as a benchmark, with each film achieving iconic status and commercial success. The LCU began with Kaithi (2019), starring Karthi, and gained massive traction when Lokesh followed up with Vikram (2022), featuring Kamal Haasan, Vijay Sethupathi, Fahadh Faasil and Suriya; and the addition of “Thalapathy” Vijay’s Leo (2023) took the LCU to new heights. Though Vijay’s entry into politics and his subsequent retirement from cinema have impacted the franchise’s trajectory, Lokesh appears determined to see his vision through.</p>
    <p>The director recently shared his plans for the franchise and the roadmap ahead. “The opening (first film) was so good. Now it’s structure is that there are only three films in the universe (so far). So, the fourth and fifth movies should be two basements, the sixth should be the pre-climax and the seventh or eighth should be the end. Going by that, I will get to do Kaithi 2, Rolex standalone and Vikram 2. If Vijay sir hadn’t announced retirement, I would have done Leo 2 as well. Then Leo 2 or Vikram 2 would have been the final film. That’s the maximum I can do with this universe,” he said during a chat with The Hollywood Reporter India.</p>
    <h2>2. Which project is Lokesh Kanagaraj in talks with Aamir Khan for? Is it Rajinikanth’s Coolie?</h2>
    <img src="./img/lokesh-aamir-rajini-05112024.avif">
    <p>For the past few weeks, rumours have been swirling that director Lokesh Kanagaraj’s upcoming actioner Coolie, starring “Superstar” Rajinikanth in the lead role, might feature a cameo by Bollywood icon Aamir Khan. The film already boasts an impressive cast, including Nagarjuna, Upendra, Soubin Shahir, Shruti Haasan and Sathyaraj, and reports of Aamir’s involvement have only heightened excitement among audiences. Now, Lokesh himself has addressed these speculations.</p>
    <h2>3. Inside R Madhavan’s Dubai home as he hosts Ajith Kumar for Diwali celebrations</h2>
    <img src="./img/Ajith-Kumar-attends-Madhavan-and-Saritas-Diwali-bash.avif">
    <p>The rather reclusive Ajith Kumar has been showcasing quite a presence on social media recently. While his fans and Tamil cinema audience went years together without seeing a photo or video of him, it has not been the case in recent times. With his looks from his upcoming film, Good Bad Ugly, taking the internet by storm, he is also making quite an impact with developments on the racing front. Now, a recent picture of him being part of the Diwali festivities at the Dubai residence of actor Madhavan and his wife Sarita has gone viral. </p>
    <h2>4. First look of Madhavan’s Adhirshtasaali: Is Maddy playing a dual role or has Mithran Jawahar whipped up something special?</h2>
    <img src="./img/First-look-of-Madhavan-starrer-Adhirshtasaali-is-out.avif">
    <p>Director Mithran Jawahar, known for his films with Dhanush, especially their recent collaboration, Thiruchitrambalam, is back with his next. Titled, Adhirshtasaali, the film stars Madhavan in the lead alongside Madonna Sebastian, Radikaa Sarathkumar, and Sai Dhansika. Recently, the makers released the first look poster of the film, which promises to be quite an intriguing ride.</p>
    <p>In the first look, we see Madhavan in twin roles of a suave and wealthy businessman in an urban setting and a worried and pensive person in an almost fairytale-ish countryside setting. Written by Jeyamohan, Adhirshtasaali marks the maiden collaboration of Madhavan and Mithran. The film has been shot across various locations in Scotland, and is billed to be one of the most expensive films of Mithran.</p>
    <h2>5. Suriya teases update on standalone Rolex film; reveals Lokesh Kanagaraj gave him Rolex’s dialogues just before shooting: ‘I don’t know if…’</h2>
    <img src="./img/suriya-rolex-30102024-1.webp">
    <p>“Sir! Just sir!” It’s doubtful if any other recent movie character is instantly recognisable from just two such words, but that’s the impact Rolex (Suriya) from Lokesh Kanagaraj’s Vikram (2022) has had on the audience. Even though the film featured actors like Kamal Haasan, Vijay Sethupathi, Fahadh Faasil, Gayathrie Shankar and Chemban Vinod Jose in throughout roles, the extended cameo of Rolex etched itself into the minds of cinephiles, thanks to Kanagaraj’s brilliant character crafting and Suriya’s commanding screen presence.</p>
    <p>Recently, Suriya opened up about playing the iconic character, revealing that he did not prepare for Rolex beforehand. “I didn’t get the scene papers till morning (of the shooting day). I knew what was happening and that I was coming only for the last two minutes. It was just half a day’s shoot. There was no prep. Once they lit up (the set) and set up the camera, the dialogues were given, saying ‘this is what you’re going to do and behave. If you like to walk on the table, you can.’ It was all just candid and spontaneous,” he said during a chat with The Hollywood Reporter India.</p>
